		<h3>Introduction:</h3>
          <blockquote>
		  <p>
        We all know that most MCUs we use for our projects are time-agnostic; simply put 
        they are unaware of the time around them. It’s OK for most of our projects but once 
        in a while when you come across an idea where keeping time is a prime concern, 
        RTC module is a savior. It’s perfect for projects containing data-logging, 
        clock-building, time stamping, timers, alarms and any real time based automation's as well.

         <br><br>There are different kinds of RTC module available in the market. We are 
         using the most common RTC module that comes with the DS1307 from <strong>MAXIM</strong>. 
         This application note provides information on how to interface a DS1307 real-time 
         clock (RTC) to a 8051 microcontroller.

      <h3>DS1307 Features :</h3>
            
      <ul>
          <li>Real-time clock (RTC) counts seconds, minutes, hours, date of the month, 
            month, day of the week, and year with leap-year compensation valid up to 2100</li>
          <li>56-byte, battery-backed, nonvolatile (NV) RAM for data storage</li>
          <li>Two-wire serial interface.</li>
          <li>Programmable square wave output signal.</li> 
          <li>Automatic power-fail detect and switch circuitry.</li>
          <li>Consumes less than 500nA in battery backup mode with oscillator running.</li>
          <li>Available in 8-pin DIP or SOIC.</li>
          <li>Optional industrial temperature range: -40°C to +85°C</li>

      <h3>Pin Description :</h3>

        <div class="capt_cont">Fig: DS1307 circuit</div>


        <ul>
          <li>Pin 1, 2 <strong>X1, X2</strong> : These are the pins used to connect an external 
              crystal oscillator to provide the clock source for the chip. According to the 
              datasheet quartz crystal of 32.768 kHz should be used along with this chip.</li>
          <li>Pin 3 <strong>V BAT</strong> : This pin is used to connect a +3V lithium battery          
              to provide supply when the external supply voltage is not available. This pin 
              should be grounded when not in use.</li>
          <li>Pin 5 <strong>SDA</strong>: Serial data input/output for the I2C serial interface.</li>
          <li>Pin 5 <strong>SCL</strong>: Serial clock input. It is the I2C interface clock input 
              and is used in data synchronization.</li>
          <li>Pin 7 <strong>SQW/OUT</strong>: This output pin provides pulse ranging from 
              frequency 1 kHz, 4kHz, 8 kHz or 32 kHz and needs a pull up resistor to operate.</li>
          <li>Pin 8 <strong>Vcc</strong>: + 5V Supply.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="capt_cont">Fig: RTC Memory Mapping</div>
 
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The DS1307 has a total of 64 bytes of RAM with address ranging from 00H  to 3FH 
            where the first seven bytes are used for time values while the next byte is the 
            control register which controls the SQW/OUT pin in the chip. The rest of the bytes 
            from 08H to 3FH is available for general purpose data storage.
          </p>
          </blockquote>
  

        <h3>How Works ?</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Register Pointer</strong> : This DS1307 chip holds a register pointer that 
            marks the byte that will be accessed next for the operation. After each read/write 
            operation the register pointer is automatically incremented which is highly useful 
            in multibyte read write.

            <br><br>
          </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Time Format in RTC DS1307</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The data such as time, minute, year etc are given stored in the BCD format. 
              As you can see in the address mapping that each byte was allotted to values 
              such as seconds, minute, hour,day, month and year. Since the representation 
              of data was in BCD format the lower four bits count up to where as top four/three 
              bits count the rest of the data values.
            </p>
          </blockquote>


          <h3>Writing to or Reading from DS1307</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              In order to perform the read or write operation in the DS1307 you need to follow the below steps.
            </p>
          </blockquote>


          <ul>
            <li>To access DS1307 we need to transmit the address of the chip + direction bit which specifies 
                the read or write operation right after the START condition is initiated by the controller.</li>
            <li>Transmit the address DS1307  1101000 (will be specified in the datasheet) + “0” bit for 
                write operation or “1” for read operation.</li>
            <li>You can set the register pointer address by transmitting the respective data byte address 
                from 00H to 06H and then the read/write operation can be performed.</li>
            <li>Remember that the value of the register pointer will be automatically incremented which 
                will help for multiple read or write operations.</li> 
          </ul>

        <h3>Circuit Discussion :</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>AT89S52 is a typical 8051 microcontroller manufactured by Atmel. Interfacing an 
              RTC module to 8051 microcontroller is pretty simple. You only need to make 2 
              connections between the RTC module and 8051. So lets get to business!

              <br><br>The DS1307 operates as a slave device on the serial bus. Access is 
              obtained by implementing a START condition and providing a device identification 
              code followed by a register address. Subsequent registers can be accessed 
              sequentially until a STOP condition is executed. The START and STOP conditions 
              are generated using the low level drives, SEND\_START and SEND\_STOP found in 
              the attached DS5000 code. Also the subroutines SEND\_BYTE and READ\_BYTE provide 
              the 2-wire handshaking required for writing and reading 8-bit words to and from the DS1307.
